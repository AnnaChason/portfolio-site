# My Portfolio Website
This project is currently a work in progress, but I’m excited to share it! I decided to have some fun with the design, so I've made the site look like a bookshelf. It has been both challenging and rewarding, giving me the chance to strengthen my skills in React and Tailwind especially. 

## 🛠️ Built With
